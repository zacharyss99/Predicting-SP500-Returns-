Video Comments:

Very good work from a technical point of view.
Unfortunately, the presentation was a bit too fast at times, making it somewhat difficult to follow. On the other hand, you appeared very confident and sure of what you were presenting (this is excellent; no one knows this project better than you).
One area for improvement is the amount of content on each slide. Some slides were overloaded, leaving insufficient time to fully analyze the information. That said, your strong command of the techniques learned in class was evident.


Notebook Comments:

Incredible work, your analysis was such that at times you had more text than code, that is impressive and I loved it. Very good comments and you could see the level of depth that was done in each section (EDA, base mode, importance of the characteristics, etc.). Excellent work. Thank you for considering all my comments, it was a pleasure working with you this semester, guys.

Best
